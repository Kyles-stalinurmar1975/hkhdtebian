OMG, just finished watching The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep, and like, what even was that? Honestly, some parts just had me laughing out loud, but not sure that’s what they were going for, you know what I mean? 😂

> I swear, these sirens... like, I’ve never seen so much glitter and screaming in one place. Who even decided that was a good idea?! It’s like a weird mix of a horror and a kids' dance recital. Anyway, Geralt... that dude always makes me think, Bro, maybe lay off on the brooding for a minute and just chill. But nope, always super intense with that guy. Kinda love him for it though. 

Wait, did you download the movie or watch the movie in theaters? I just grabbed it online bc I couldn’t be bothered to go out in this weather. Freaking storm out here is no joke.

And Yennefer, seriously, she... just, I dunno, her character this time around was all over the place. Like, woman, what’s your DEAL today? One sec she’s all powerful witch flex, next she's dealing with some random emotional crisis. But hey, guess that’s kinda relatable in a weird way. 🤷‍♀️

Geralt’s armor was so shiny, I kept thinking the guy has a squire just for polishing him up every day before work. Well, it works, 'cause when the sirens were going nuts, he just took them down like a champ. Though, siren music reminded me of Gillian’s crazy karaoke nights... you never know if it’s terrifying or just too funny.

if (magic == real) { take_my_money(); }  # No idea what this does 🤷‍♀️

And yeah, now I’m yelling at the screen like, “Why do I love this nonsense series so much?” But who am I kidding, I’ll totally rewatch it. Or maybe find some behind-the-scenes stuff to giggle at. Got any to recommend?
